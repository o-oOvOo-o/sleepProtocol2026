# 🚀 Meme Token Launchpad on X Layer

A Pump.fun-style meme token launchpad built on the **X Layer chain (OKX zkEVM L2)** with automatic bonding curve mechanics and DEX integration.

## 🌟 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Instant Token Creation**: Users can mint new meme tokens by paying a small fee in OKB
- **Bonding Curve Model**: Automatic pricing and liquidity accumulation through linear bonding curve mechanics
- **OKB Pool Mechanism**: Fees collected in OKB are pooled until reaching the 80 OKB threshold
- **DEX Integration**: Automatic liquidity provision to DEXs on X Layer once threshold is met
- **Fee Distribution**: Smart fee distribution between platform, creators, and referrers

### Technical Features
- **Smart Contract Framework**: Built with Solidity and OpenZeppelin contracts
- **Bonding Curve Algorithm**: Linear price increase based on tokens sold
- **Automatic Liquidity Management**: 36 OKB permanently locked for base liquidity
- **Referral System**: Built-in referral rewards for token promotion
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient contract design for X Layer deployment
- **Frontend UI**: Clean, user-friendly website with OKX Wallet / MetaMask integration

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. **TokenFactory.sol**
- Main contract managing token creation and bonding curve integration
- Handles fee collection and distribution
- Manages liquidity threshold monitoring
- Coordinates between tokens and bonding curves

#### 2. **MemeToken.sol**
- ERC-20 token template with 1 billion initial supply
- Owner-controlled minting and burning capabilities
- Standard ERC-20 functionality

#### 3. **BondingCurve.sol**
- Linear bonding curve implementation
- Automatic price calculation based on supply
- Buy/sell mechanics with price discovery

### Bonding Curve Mechanics
- **Initial Price**: 0.0001 OKB per token
- **Price Increment**: 0.00001 OKB per token sold
- **Formula**: `Price = InitialPrice + (TotalSold × PriceIncrement)`

### Fee Structure
- **Token Creation Fee**: 0.1 OKB
- **Platform Fee**: 40% of creation fee
- **Creator Fee**: 40% of creation fee
- **Referrer Fee**: 20% of creation fee (if referrer exists)

### Liquidity Management
- **Threshold**: 80 OKB accumulated fees
- **Permanently Locked**: 36 OKB for base liquidity
- **DEX Provision**: Remaining 44 OKB automatically added to DEX
